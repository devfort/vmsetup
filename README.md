# /dev/fort VM setup scripts

These scripts take a base Ubuntu install and build a working "fort" VM, with trac and subversion installed the way we like them. First run `fortify`, then create a file `users` containing the names of all users, and finally run `occupy` with the name of your project. If you get no errors: you're done.
